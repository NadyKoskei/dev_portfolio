    <h1>Hello, I am Nady Koskei</h1> <!-- a breif profesional introduction -->
    <p>
      I'm a passionate creative with a vision to build digital experiences that
      uplift and empower. Whether it's designing intuitive web interfaces or
      crafting apps that serve real-world communities, I approach every project
      with heart, purpose and a deep respect for the people who will use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey into tech is rooted in curiosity and care. I'm currently
      learning development using MERN Stack, laying the groundwork to build
      inclusive platforms that blend design, functionality and security. I
      believe that technology should be both beautiful and safe, which is why
      I'm also diving into cybersecurity and digital forensics so as to protect
      the spaces I help create.
